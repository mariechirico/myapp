			What makes this website a good design is because it has a lot of information but is laid out in a way that seems simple. What is important, like log in, is highlighted so that it is easy to find. Also, sections are well defined.

			<li>
			This is a very simple website I designed before this class as a project for a tribute page. I believe it is an example of good design because it is simple, aesthetically pleasing, communicates what it needs to, and is mobile friendly.

			<ul>
			<li>
			Art at Yale University website is actually pretty badly designed. The background is very distracting and there is a lot of space to the right that is unused. What is really interesting is how this website is able to be edited by anyone so it is a "hodge-podge" of many designers, which isn't working out well. 
			</li>

		</td>	
		<td><h4><a href="http://www.wateronwheels.com/">Example 2</a></h4>
			<ul>
			<li>
			This is an example of poor web design because it is unfinished or if it isn't, the design makes the website seem unfinished. Navigating around the website is difficult. Also, I believe that some of the text is left over from default starter text.
