	<p>HTML5, <em>Hyper Text Markup Language 5</em>, is the newest version of HTML. 
	<p>It incorporates what has already been established in previous versions of HTML while adding new tags and attributes which can work with Javascript better. 
	<p>According to <a href="" title="Tech Radar">Tech Radar</a>, "HTML5 has been designed to deliver almost everything you'd want to do online without requiring additional software such as browser plugins. 
	<p>It does everything from animation to apps, music to movies, and can also be used to build incredibly complicated applications that run in your browser."
	<p>What that means is that HTML5 is adapting to the complexity that the World Wide Web is evolving to be. 
	<p>With better integration with other languages, we will be able to do more with the basic structure of the website and make <em>lighter</em> markup files. 
	<p>Also, because of everything HTML5 can do, it is making certain programs obsolete, like Silverlight and Flash.
