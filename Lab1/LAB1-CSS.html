	<center><p><h1>Let's learn about CSS.</h1>
	<p>CSS stands for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>. It works with HTML to make up pages on the web.
	<p>It is considered a Design Language and provides the visual aspects of a webpage. 
	<p>As you can see on this webpage, I am not using CSS and it is very <em>bland</em>.
	<p>Some advantages of using CSS is that it saves time and because it is more compact of a language, webpages can load faster. 
	<p>The way CSS works is that it is a file that holds Global style tags that can be called upon from HTML pages. For example, text font and colors can be set globally and call upon with a simple tag. 
	<p>Lastly, CSS can work on many different types of browsers and devices.
