	<center><p><h1>So, what is HTML?</h1>
	<p>HTML stands for <b><em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em></b>. HTML is the backbone of web pages, the structure that makes up what we see on the web. 
	<p>HTML is a language that is written into a file that is able to be displayed on the web. It is made up of elements, or tags, that tell the web browser how to display the information. 
	<p>Some examples of tags include p, which starts a new paragraph, h1, which tells the browser to show the text as a Header, and em, which places <em>emphasis</em> on the text. 
	<p>HTML was developed in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee. 
	<p>We know that HTML is the basic make up of the web pages but also works with other languages like <a href"LAB1-CSS.html">CSS</a> to make what is seen today in most webpages.
