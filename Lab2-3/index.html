	<h3><a id="Waterfall"></a>Waterfall</h3>
	<p>There are many different ways to approach software development but one well known strategy is Waterfall. 
	<p>Waterfall is an older way of development but is still used on teams. What makes the name Waterfall is that each step of the development <em>flows</em> into the next step. 
	<p>Each step is very distinguished from the next step. For example, the Business Analyst will work with the client to determine the requirements for the software.
	<p>Next, the developers will take the requirements, design, then code the software. While the developers will do basic unit testing in their process, the next step involves the testers.
	<p>The software testers will go through the software and functionally determine if the software is working the way the client wants it and if it works the way it was designed. 
	<p>Lastly, the software is tested by the client to determine if they approve of the final product. 
	<p>Even though each step works after the previous step, it doesn't mean that when one step is done in the process. Each step can revisit the previous step, especially if problems arise.

	<h3><a id="TestvQA"></a>Software Testing vs Quality Assurance</h3>
	<p>Many people use <em>Tester</em> and <em>Quality Assurance</em> interchangeably but that is incorrect. While they do similar tasks, their goals can be very different.
	<p>Testers and QA both run tests on software at some point in the development process. Testers might only focus on making sure the software works and developing bug reports for the developers. 
	<p>Quality Assurance want to make sure that the software is usable and the user is able to go through the process without much difficulty. Other aspects QA focuses on are speed of the program and accessibility.
	<p>What I have found through my experiences is that even people in the industry use the terms interchangeably because of personal preference.
